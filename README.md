My competitive programming algorithms.

### Introduction

Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook.

A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical problems, also known as puzzles, to the contestants (who can vary in number from tens to several thousands), and contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem.

Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, memory usage, program size, etc).

### Algorithms

At the beginning of each published algorithm, in a comment block, there is more information such as the number, origin and description of the challenge.

Below this description is the algorithm for solution. To run locally, you just need `node` installed, and so run, for example, `node algorithm.js`.
